"""Compare the managed AdGuard config with the live one (installed by app_adguard, run as root on the guest).

Usage: hm1-adguard-drift MANAGED.yaml LIVE.yaml

Every key the managed file sets must be present with the same value in the live file (dicts: subset match, so keys
AdGuard adds itself, such as filter last_updated, are ignored; lists: same length, item by item). Duration strings
(720h, 30d, 168h0m0s) are compared by value, because AdGuard rewrites them in its own format (168h -> 7d). Prints only the
PATHS that differ (never values: the config holds the admin hash). Exit 0 = in sync, 1 = drift, 2 = cannot compare.
